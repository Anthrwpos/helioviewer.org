HelioViewer ChangeLog

1. Implemented partial support for Internet Explorer (IE). There are still some issues
   however with UI components including the loading indicator and SelectByDateMenu.
   See item #3 for more details on changes made.

2. FIXED Bug #193280 "Page reload (caching) fails for Opera and IE"
	An issue with using the onload event in conjunction with an image element, and
	Opera / IE's caching mechanism prevent tiles from properly loading after a
	page reload. A solution to this problem involved setting the src of the
	image after the event handlers have been defined and attached. (See links
	#3 and #4 under the "more information" section at the bottom).
	
3. Changed syntax relating to element creation to make better use of Prototype's
	Element class functionality. This is related to item #1 since supporting IE
	requires manually extending all Elements to support Prototype's Element class
	methods (this occurs automatically in Firefox, Safari and Opera). All instances
	of document.createElement() and *.getElementByXXX were replaced to use the newer
	syntax.
	
	For example:
	
		var htmlElement = document.createElement('span');
		htmlElement.className = 'selectByDateMenu';
		
	was replaced with:
	
		var htmlElement = new Element('span', {'class': 'selectByDateMenu'});
		
	(Alternatively, it would also suffice to wrap the document.createElement(..)
	statement with prototype's $() function, however the syntax of the later
	is  much cleaner and more concise.)
	
4. Changed SunImage's tileDir member variable initialization 
   (in SelectByDateMenu.js) from absolute to relative path structure. This
   prevents a bug from occurring when domain name is different from what
   is expected, e.g. when working on a local development server.)
   
5. Changed size of layer menu from 680px to 700px to eliminate overflow issues.

6. Fixed spelling error for array name in LayerManager.js ("Colums" -> "Columns")

Version: alpha

1. Upgraded to Prototype 1.6.0.2 / script.aculo.us 1.8.1 (from prototype 1.5.1/
   script.aculo.us 1.7.1_beta3). Newer versions include better OO support, 
   security fixes, ie bug fixes and better performance. The new libraries 
   are NOT however backwards compatable, and several changes were necessary 
   for HelioViewer (HV) to work properly with the newer libraries:
	  	* In prototype 1.6, Hashes require the use of accessors and mutators 
	  	  instead of simply using dot or bracket access. A simple solution 
	  	  however was to use the Hash#toObject() method to convert all hashes
	  	  to Objects before using them to extend any classes. (HV uses a
	  	  "defaultOptions" hash for many classes in order to pass some default
	  	  parameters to the class constructor.)
	  	* getElementsByClassName is deprecated in 1.6, so instances of it
	  	  were switched for either select(), or, in cases where only the 
	  	  first element was needed, down().
	  	* Position#cumulativeOffset is deprecated: switched all instances to 
	  	  use Element#cumulativeOffset.

2. Removed redundant class definition for ZoomLevelSlider. ZoomLevelSlider.js
   contained two identical copies of the class definition for ZoomLevelSlider.
   One of the copies was removed from the file.
   
3. Disabled the debugging console output Textarea. With Firebug installed,
   all messages sent to Debug will output to the Firebug console, thus removing
   the necessity to have a separate error console. It can be re-enabled easily
   by simply uncommenting the relevant code in index.html.
