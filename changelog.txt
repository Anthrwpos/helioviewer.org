HelioViewer ChangeLog


02/13/2008
version: alpha

1. Upgraded to Prototype 1.6.0.2 / script.aculo.us 1.8.1 (from prototype 1.5.1/
   script.aculo.us 1.7.1_beta3). Newer versions include better OO support, 
   security fixes, ie bug fixes and better performance. The new libraries 
   are NOT however backwards compatable, and several changes were necessary 
   for HelioViewer (HV) to work properly with the newer libraries:
	  	* In prototype 1.6, Hashes require the use of accessors and mutators 
	  	  instead of simply using dot or bracket access. A simple solution 
	  	  however was to use the Hash#toObject() method to convert all hashes
	  	  to Objects before using them to extend any classes. (HV uses a
	  	  "defaultOptions" hash for many classes in order to pass some default
	  	  parameters to the class constructor.)
	  	* getElementsByClassName is deprecated in 1.6, so instances of it
	  	  were switched for either select(), or, in cases where only the 
	  	  first element was needed, down().
	  	* Position#cumulativeOffset is deprecated: switched all instances to 
	  	  use Element#cumulativeOffset.

2. Removed redundant class definition for ZoomLevelSlider. ZoomLevelSlider.js
   contained two identical copies of the class definition for ZoomLevelSlider.
   One of the copies was removed from the file.
   
3. Disabled the debugging console output Textarea. With Firebug installed,
   all messages sent to Debug will output to the Firebug console, thus removing
   the necessity to have a separate error console. It can be re-enabled easily
   by simply uncommenting the relevant code in index.html.
